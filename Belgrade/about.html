      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when
        it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of
        sovereignity, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.</p>

        The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which
        lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial
        Ottoman influence. </p>

      <h2>The capital of Serbia</h2>
      <p>Belgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava
        rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th
        century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the
        left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the
        Danube, like Krnjača, Kotež and Borča, also merged with the city, while Pančevo, a heavily industrialised
        satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while
        together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi). On the right bank of the Sava, central
        Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The
        mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and
        Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.[98]</p>

      <p>Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia[12] and is one of the five statistical regions that
        make up the country. Its metropolitan territory is divided into 17 municipalities, each with its own local
        council.[13] The city of Belgrade covers 3.6% of Serbia's territory, and around 24% of the country's population
        lives within its administrative limits.[5] It is classified as a Beta-Global City.[14]</p>
